"../logic/user.c": Warning - Reverting to -op0: file has no entry functions!

extern void dummy() is called from 0 sites in this file.
    It appears to be inlineable (size = 1 units)
    It has 3 non-trivial scope blocks nested 3 deep.
    It calls these functions:

extern void set_value() is called from 0 sites in this file.
    It has 3 non-trivial scope blocks nested 3 deep.
    It calls these functions:
	idle_loop() (1 times)
	 ? () (1 times)
	norm_arrow() (1 times)
	button_repeat_off() (1 times)
	display_symbol() (2 times)
	set_blink_rate() (2 times)
	button_repeat_on() (1 times)
	stop_buzzer() (1 times)
	clear_blink_mem() (2 times)


These functions may be recursive:
	set_value()

These external functions are called but not defined here:
	clear_blink_mem()
	stop_buzzer()
	button_repeat_on()
	set_blink_rate()
	display_symbol()
	button_repeat_off()
	norm_arrow()
	 ? ()
	idle_loop()
